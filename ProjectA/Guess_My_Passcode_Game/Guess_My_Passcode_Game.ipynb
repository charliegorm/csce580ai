A computer can \"learn\" to play this game using an algorithm called **backpropagation**.

In fact, it can be simply understood using many of the techniques you may have already learned from playing \"Guess My Passcode\". At its core, backpropagation is built on three strategies from the game:\n","\n","**Strategy 1. Learn from Feedback**\n","\n","Every round, each guess for a digit can be updated (by adding or subtracting) based on feedback you got from the target number. You may have tried to update your guesses so that it would move the total closer to the target number.\n","\n","**Strategy 2. Big Updates for Big Differences**\n","\n","How much to update your guesses is proportional to the difference between the total and the target number. For example, suppose the total for a given round was 50. Would you be more likely to update your guess if the target number was 45, or if it was 10?\n","\n","**Strategy 3. Update Each Digit Individually**\n","\n","How much to update each digit in your guess changes based on value of each multiplier.
