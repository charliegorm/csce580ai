> [Guess My Passcode](https://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2025/passcode/)
### Requirements to Run
> - python -m pip install ipywidgets matplotlib ipython
### Environment Used
> - Used the Python3.13.7 (Project A) venv included in this project directory, have to activate it when running the "Guess_My_Passcode_Game.ipynb" notebook file. 
### Flow
> - Once you run the main / first code block, scroll down to where the output would be (below the code block).
> - It will prompt you asking how many digits the phone passcode should have, start with 1. 
> - Try to guess what digit / multiplier combination works. Once you get three correct guesses in a row, the phone is unlocked and you can play again. Increase to 2 (or however many you wish) digits and repeat.
